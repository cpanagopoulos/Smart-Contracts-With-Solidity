# Using Smart Contracts To Manage Joint Savings Accounts 

![alt=“”](Images/20-5-challenge-image.png)

## Background

A fintech startup company is disrupting the finance industry with its own cross-border, Ethereum-compatible blockchain that connects financial institutions. Currently, the team is building smart contracts to automate many of the institutions’ financial processes and features, such as hosting joint savings accounts.

To automate the creation of joint savings accounts, create a Solidity smart contract that accepts two user addresses. These addresses will be able to control a joint savings account. Your smart contract will use ether management functions to implement a financial institution’s requirements for providing the features of the joint savings account. These features will consist of the ability to deposit and withdraw funds from the account.

## Tasks Completed

1. Build Smart Contract in Solidity for the Joint Savings Account.

2. Compile and Deploy the Contract in the JavaScript VM.

3. Interact with the Smart Contract to confirm accounts successfully transact.

## Deliverables

* A Smart Contract for the Joint Savings accounts.

* Separate folder to include images that confirm the deposit and withdrawal transactions.
